SALES FORECASTING PROJECT REPORT
--------------------------------

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on forecasting retail sales using historical Walmart sales data.
The objective is to analyze past sales trends, identify seasonality, and build reliable
time-series forecasting models to predict future sales. Accurate forecasting helps
businesses improve inventory planning, demand management, and strategic decision-making.

The analysis was performed using Python in Google Colab with time-series techniques such
as Moving Average and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing.


2. DATASET DETAILS
The dataset contains historical weekly sales data from Walmart stores along with
supporting economic and environmental variables.

Key Columns:
- Date: Weekly sales date
- Weekly_Sales: Total sales amount
- Store: Store identifier
- Holiday_Flag: Indicates holiday weeks
- Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment: External influencing factors

The weekly sales data was aggregated to a monthly level to better capture long-term
trends and seasonal patterns.


3. METHODOLOGY
The project followed a structured forecasting pipeline:
- Data loading and cleaning
- Date conversion and time indexing
- Monthly sales aggregation
- Trend visualization and seasonality analysis
- Rolling mean analysis to confirm seasonality
- Time-based train-test split (80% train, 20% test)
- Model building using:
  - Moving Average (baseline model)
  - Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing
- Forecasting future sales periods
- Model evaluation using MAE and MAPE metrics


4. MODEL PERFORMANCE
The Moving Average model provided a simple baseline but failed to capture trend and
seasonality effectively.

The Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing model performed significantly better by capturing:
- Long-term trend
- Seasonal fluctuations
- Changes in demand over time

Evaluation Metrics:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~1.8 × 10^7
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): ~6–7%

These results indicate strong forecasting accuracy for retail sales data.


5. BUSINESS INSIGHTS
- Sales show strong seasonality with consistent peaks during holiday months
  (November–December).
- Post-holiday months experience a noticeable decline in sales.
- Sales trends remain relatively stable year-over-year, indicating predictable demand
  cycles.
- Seasonal forecasting models are essential for retail businesses to avoid understocking
  or overstocking.

Business Impact:
- Helps optimize inventory levels
- Improves supply chain planning
- Supports promotional and pricing strategies
- Reduces operational costs due to better demand estimation


6. FUTURE SALES PREDICTIONS
The trained Holt-Winters model was used to forecast future sales periods.
The forecasted values continue the observed seasonal pattern, with higher sales during
holiday periods and moderate sales during non-holiday months.

These forecasts can assist businesses in:
- Planning inventory procurement
- Staffing decisions
- Marketing campaign timing
- Financial forecasting and budgeting


7. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT
To further improve forecasting accuracy and business value:
- Use SARIMA models for advanced seasonal modeling
- Incorporate external variables such as promotions and holidays explicitly
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Extend the forecast horizon for long-term planning
- Compare statistical models with machine learning approaches (XGBoost, LSTM)


8. FINAL CONCLUSION
The sales forecasting project successfully demonstrated how time-series analysis can be
used to predict future retail sales. Among the models tested, Holt-Winters Exponential
Smoothing provided the most accurate and reliable results by capturing both trend and
seasonality. The insights derived from this analysis can help businesses make informed,
data-driven decisions and improve overall operational efficiency.
